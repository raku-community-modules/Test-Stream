=head1 NAME

Test::Stream - Stream test events

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use Test::Stream;

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a prototype of an event-based test framework. The goal is to produce
an underlying set of modules that can be shared by all Test modules in the
Raku ecosystem. Building this on top of an abstract test event system makes
integrating different modules much easier. It also makes testing your test
modules *much* easier, and allows for output formats besides TAP.
